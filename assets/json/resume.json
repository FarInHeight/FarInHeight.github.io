However, recent advancements in VPR methods have significantly improved performance, challenging the necessity of re-ranking. In this work, we show that modern retrieval systems often reach a point where re-ranking can degrade results, as current VPR datasets are largely saturated. We propose using image matching as a verification step to assess retrieval confidence, demonstrating that inlier counts can reliably predict when re-ranking is beneficial. Our findings shift the paradigm of retrieval pipelines, offering insights for more robust and adaptive VPR systems."}],"skills":[{"name":"Office Suite","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Office Automation"]},{"name":"Presentation Software","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Office Automation"]},{"name":"Spreadsheets","level":"Advanced","icon":"","keywords":["Office Automation"]},{"name":"Web Browser","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Office Automation"]},{"name":"Word Processors","level":"Advanced","icon":"","keywords":["Office Automation"]},{"name":"CAD - Assisted Design","level":"Intermediate","icon":"","keywords":["Application Software"]},{"name":"CSS","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Markup Language"]},{"name":"HTML","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Markup Language"]},{"name":"LaTeX","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Markup Language"]},{"name":"Markdown","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Markup Language"]},{"name":"C","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"Java","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"Forth","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"JavaScript","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"MATLAB","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"Prolog","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"Python","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"Rust","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Programming Language"]},{"name":"SQL","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Query Language"]},{"name":"Web Programming","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Web Programming"]},{"name":"Network Architecture","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Systems and Network Management"]},{"name":"Operating Systems","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Systems and Network Management"]},{"name":"DBMS","level":"Highly Specialised","icon":"","keywords":["Data Management"]},{"name":"Graphics and Multimedia","level":"Intermediate","icon":"","keywords":["Graphics and Multimedia"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Italian","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Limited","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Artificial Intelligence","Deep Learning","Machine Learning","Computational Intelligence","Explainable AI","Trustworthy AI"]}]}
