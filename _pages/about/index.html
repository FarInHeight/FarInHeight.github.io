I’m currently working on my MSc Thesis under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://cmas1.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Carlo Masone</a> at the <a href="https://ellis.eu/units/turin" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ELLIS Unit in Turin</a> directed by Professor <a href="http://www.tatianatommasi.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tatiana Tommasi</a>. My work focuses on the application of Latent Diffusion Models for the Visual Place Recognition task and the application of uncertainty estimation techniques to enhance the models’ robustness.</p> <p>I am intrigued by the multifaceted aspects of Artificial Intelligence. However, I am especially drawn to the intersection of Explainable AI and Robust, Trustworthy AI within the field of Computer Vision. I believe that these combined areas are essential for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, taking into account both ethical considerations and performance metrics. I am passionate about research and hope that I can make a meaningful contribution to these fields. I am excited about the possibility of pursuing a PhD and of collaborating with esteemed researchers.</p> </body></html>
