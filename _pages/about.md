Hi, I’m Davide Sferrazza 💭, a first-year [ELLIS PhD Student](https://ellis.eu/research/phd-postdoc) at [VANDAL Lab](https://vandal.polito.it/) in [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en/), working under the joint supervision of Prof. [Tatiana Tommasi](http://www.tatianatommasi.com/) and Prof. [Carlo Masone](https://cmas1.github.io/).

After completing my Master’s thesis titled [*Understanding and Enhancing Visual Place Recognition through Embedding Space Interpretability and Uncertainty Estimation*](https://webthesis.biblio.polito.it/35407/1/tesi.pdf), supervised by Prof. [Carlo Masone](https://cmas1.github.io/), I shifted my focus to the exciting field of Trustworthy AI. Specifically, I’m exploring the intersection of multi-modal deep learning and trustworthy AI, developing systems that are transparent, robust, reliable and efficient.
