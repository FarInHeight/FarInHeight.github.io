Hi, I'm Davide Sferrazza üí≠, a newly graduated **MSc student** in [AI and Data Analytics](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.offerta_formativa_2019.vis?p_coorte=2023&p_sdu=37&p_cds=18&p_ori=13087) @ [PoliTo](https://www.polito.it/en/).\
Currently, I have just finished working on my Master‚Äôs thesis titled **_Understanding and Enhancing Visual Place Recognition through Embedding Space Interpretability and Uncertainty Estimation_** under the supervision of Professor [Carlo Masone](https://cmas1.github.io/) at the [ELLIS Unit in Turin](https://ellis.eu/units/turin) directed by Professor [Tatiana Tommasi](http://www.tatianatommasi.com/). \
My work focuses on the application of Latent Diffusion Models for the Visual Place Recognition task and the application of uncertainty estimation techniques to enhance the models' robustness.

I am intrigued by the multifaceted aspects of Artificial Intelligence. However, I am especially drawn to the intersection of Explainable AI and Robust, Trustworthy AI within the field of Computer Vision. I believe that these combined areas are essential for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, taking into account both ethical considerations and performance metrics. \
I am passionate about research and hope that I can make a meaningful contribution to these fields. I am excited about the possibility of pursuing a PhD and of collaborating with esteemed researchers.
