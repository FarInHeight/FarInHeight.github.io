Hi, I'm Davide Sferrazza, a MSc student in <a href="https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.offerta_formativa_2019.vis?p_coorte=2023&p_sdu=37&p_cds=18&p_ori=13087">AI & Data Analytics</a> @ <a href="https://www.polito.it/en/">PoliTo</a>.
I'm currently working on my MSc Thesis under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://cmas1.github.io/">Carlo Masone</a> at the <a href="https://ellis.eu/units/turin">ELLIS Unit in Turin</a> directed by Professor <a href="http://www.tatianatommasi.com/">Tatiana Tommasi</a>. 
My work focuses on the application of Latent Diffusion Models for the Visual Place Recognition task and the application of uncertainty estimation techniques to enhance the models' robustness.

I am intrigued by the multifaceted aspects of Artificial Intelligence. However, I am especially drawn to the intersection of Explainable AI and Robust, Trustworthy AI within the field of Computer Vision. I believe that these combined areas are essential for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, taking into account both ethical considerations and performance metrics.
I am passionate about research and hope that I can make a meaningful contribution to these fields. I am excited about the possibility of pursuing a PhD and of collaborating with esteemed researchers.
